Finding the best predictive model for the HAR dataset

The goal of this report is to implement methods of predictive modelling in order to not only find but compare performances between the training and test data to discover the best possible techniques through the discovery of its accuracies.

The HAR dataset is a perfect test case for this investigation as it provides a relatively small number of test subjects while maintaining a respectable amount of collected data on each of the individuals. Because the data provided by the smartphone is relative nonsense when viewed on the outside, by applying statistical and data mining techniques, the use of predictive modeling can find such relations with minimal background knowledge to predict the future outcomes of a given dataset.

By implementing the Random Forest algorithm along with the Support Vector Machine algorithms, we hope to show that there is a significant enough accuracy to comfortably state any relations within the data as well as see if there is truly a method of discovery that is substantially better than the other, and discover why that may be the case.
